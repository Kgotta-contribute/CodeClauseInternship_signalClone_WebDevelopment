# PROJECT -> SIGNAL CLONE FROM REACT NATIVE & REACT JS

- Here is my Signal Clone Application which is made using React Native, React JS and Firebase! ^_^
- The documentation & everything from working of code to recordings can be found here
- https://github.com/Kgotta-contribute/PROJECTS_On_RESUME/tree/main/signal-new-clone

- This repo is especially made for Code Clause Internship. The team alloted me this project to complete this as a part of "Web Dev Internship".
  Hope you like it & find something useful !
- app.internship.codeclause.com is Code Clause Internship website & you can consider taking this internship as it is hassle free, the person taking this must be willing to work on their own.
- Have a great time ahead!! ðŸ˜Š
